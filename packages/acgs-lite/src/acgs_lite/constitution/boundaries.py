@dataclass
class PolicyBoundary:
    """Hard permission ceiling that overrides rule-based allow decisions.

    A ``PolicyBoundary`` defines absolute forbidden zones — actions that can
    never be allowed regardless of what constitutional rules say. This is a
    safety layer *above* the governance engine: even if a rule explicitly
    allows an action, a matching boundary will block it.

    Use cases:

    - Regulatory hard stops: PCI-DSS prohibits storing raw card numbers —
      no rule can override that.
    - MACI separation-of-powers: Executors cannot approve their own work —
      enforce it at the boundary level, not just the rule level.
    - Emergency kill-switches: During an incident, add a boundary to block
      all destructive actions until the incident is resolved.

    Usage::

        from acgs_lite.constitution.boundaries import PolicyBoundary, PolicyBoundarySet

        # Define a hard ceiling
        boundary = PolicyBoundary(
            boundary_id="PCI-001",
