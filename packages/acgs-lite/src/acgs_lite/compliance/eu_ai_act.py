- Article 15: Accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity
- Article 26: Deployer obligations (fundamental-rights impact assessment)
- Article 50: Transparency for GPAI-facing / chatbot systems
- Article 53: General-purpose AI model obligations
- Article 55: Systemic-risk obligations (frontier models)

Risk tiers:
  UNACCEPTABLE → prohibited (Art. 5)
  HIGH         → full compliance track (Arts. 9-27)
  LIMITED      → transparency only (Art. 50)
  MINIMAL      → voluntary codes of practice

Council (Official Journal of the European Union, 12 July 2024)
Entered into force: 1 August 2024
Fully applicable: 2 August 2026 (high-risk AI systems)

Penalties: Up to EUR 35 million or 7% of global annual turnover (Art. 99)
for prohibited practices; EUR 15 million or 3% for other violations.
