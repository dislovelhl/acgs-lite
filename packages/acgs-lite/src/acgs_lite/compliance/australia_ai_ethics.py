"""Australia AI Ethics Framework compliance module.

Implements the eight principles of Australia's voluntary AI Ethics Framework,
published by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources (now
Department of Industry, Science and Resources) in 2019, and cross-referenced
with the Responsible AI Framework published by the Digital Transformation
Agency (2023).

The eight principles:
- PRIN-1: Human, societal and environmental wellbeing
- PRIN-2: Human-centred values
- PRIN-3: Fairness
- PRIN-4: Privacy protection and security
- PRIN-5: Reliability and safety
- PRIN-6: Transparency and explainability
- PRIN-7: Contestability
- PRIN-8: Accountability

Cross-referenced instruments:
- Australia's National AI Strategy (2021)
- Responsible AI Framework (Digital Transformation Agency, 2023)
- Privacy Act 1988 (AI-relevant provisions, 2024 reform)
- Anti-Discrimination Act obligations (Federal + State)

Reference: Australia's AI Ethics Framework — Department of Industry,
Science, Energy and Resources (2019)

Status: Voluntary; referenced in government procurement and APS AI guidance.
