"""China AI Governance Regulations compliance module.

Implements obligations from China's four major AI-specific regulations,
enforced by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and Ministry of
Industry and Information Technology (MIIT):

Reg-1: Provisions on the Administration of Algorithmic Recommendations
       (算法推荐服务管理规定) — Effective March 1, 2022
Reg-2: Provisions on the Administration of Deep Synthesis Internet
       Information Services (深度合成管理规定) — Effective January 10, 2023
Reg-3: Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial
       Intelligence Services (生成式人工智能服务管理暂行办法) — Effective August 15, 2023
Reg-4: Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) AI-relevant articles
       (个人信息保护法) — Effective November 1, 2021

Key obligations:
- Algorithm transparency labelling (Reg-1, Art.16; Reg-2, Art.17)
- Prohibitions on illegal content generation (Reg-3, Art.4)
- Training data legality and quality (Reg-3, Art.7)
- Deep-synthesis / AI-generated content labelling (Reg-2, Art.17)
- Automated decision-making transparency (PIPL Art.24)
- Opt-out from algorithmic recommendations (Reg-1, Art.17)
- Security assessment for generative AI (Reg-3, Art.17)
- Report mechanism for illegal content (Reg-3, Art.14)
