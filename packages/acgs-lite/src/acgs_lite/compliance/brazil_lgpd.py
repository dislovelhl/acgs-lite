"""Brazil Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) + AI compliance module.

Implements AI-relevant obligations from Brazil's Lei Geral de Proteção de
Dados Pessoais (LGPD, Law No. 13,709/2018) and the ANPD (National Data
Protection Authority) guidance on automated decision-making and AI systems.

Sections covered:
- Article 5:  Definitions (including automated data processing)
- Article 7:  Legal bases for personal data processing
- Article 11: Legal bases for sensitive personal data processing
- Article 17: Rights of data subjects
- Article 18: Rights to confirmation, access, and correction
- Article 20: Review of automated decisions — the AI transparency article
- Article 37: Records of data processing activities (controller obligations)
- Article 44: Security incidents and obligations
- Article 46: Security measures
- Article 47: Incident response and ANPD notification

Article 20 is the most AI-critical: it gives data subjects the right to
request a review of decisions taken solely by automated means, including
profiling, credit scoring, hiring, and similar decisions.

Reference: Lei No. 13,709, de 14 de agosto de 2018 (LGPD)
           ANPD Resolution CD/ANPD No. 2/2022 (DPIA guidance)
Enforcement: Since September 18, 2020 (administrative sanctions from August 1, 2021)
