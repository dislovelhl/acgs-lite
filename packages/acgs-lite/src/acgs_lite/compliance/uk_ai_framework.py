"""UK AI Regulatory Principles Framework compliance module.

Implements the five cross-sector AI regulatory principles published in the
UK Government's AI Regulation White Paper (March 2023, Cm 9315) and carried
forward in the AI Opportunities Action Plan (January 2025). These principles
are operationalised by UK sector regulators (FCA, ICO, CMA, MHRA, Ofcom).

Principles covered:
- PRO-1: Safety, security and robustness
- PRO-2: Appropriate transparency and explainability
- PRO-3: Fairness
- PRO-4: Accountability and governance
- PRO-5: Contestability and redress

For each principle the module captures:
(a) the core obligation
(b) evidence/documentation obligations
(c) sector-specific extensions where significant

Key sector instruments cross-referenced:
- FCA/PRA AI Discussion Paper (DP5/22) — financial services
- ICO AI Auditing Framework — data protection
- MHRA Guidance on Software and AI as Medical Devices — healthcare AI
- Equality Act 2010 — protected characteristic fairness requirements

Reference: UK AI Regulatory Framework — AI White Paper (Cm 9315, 2023)
           UK AI Opportunities Action Plan (DSIT, January 2025)
Status:    Voluntary framework; mandatory compliance derives from sector
           regulators applying these principles through existing powers.
