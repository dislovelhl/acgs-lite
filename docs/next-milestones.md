# Next Milestones for `acgs-lite`

Last updated: 2026-04-24

This note keeps the near-term roadmap visible and concrete. It is intentionally short.

## v2.10.0 — shipped 2026-04-24

All planned items are complete.

- [x] Ship the hero demo asset (`docs/assets/basic-governance-hero.gif` placeholder; live image block wired in README)
- [x] Launch public burst — v2.10.0 tagged, release notes published
- [x] Tighten repo credibility signals — issue/PR hygiene, concrete release notes, canonical three-step proof path in README and examples
- [x] Publish technical walkthrough — blocked-action demo, audit trail, and MCP governance server paths all documented in `examples/`
- [x] Learn from first external feedback — README clarity, first-run demo friction, and integration priorities addressed in v2.9.0–v2.10.0 sprint

## v2.11.0 — next milestone (planned)

Items under consideration for the next release:

- Stabilize the lifecycle HTTP API (promote from Beta to Stable, add OpenAPI schema validation tests)
- Publish `acgs-lite-rust` to PyPI (wheel build CI is wired; tag push needed after confirming `wheels.yml`)
- Improve first-run ergonomics: `acgs init` scaffolding for the most common agent frameworks
- Address any feedback from the v2.10.0 public burst (HN / Reddit / X comments → targeted doc or API fixes)
- Evaluate promoting `GovernanceStream` and `PolicyStorage` interfaces from Experimental to Beta

## Canonical proof path

The first experience with `acgs-lite` should stay:
1. block an unsafe action
2. inspect the audit evidence
3. run governance as shared infrastructure

## Definition of progress

Real progress means more people can:
- understand the wedge quickly
- run the first demo successfully
- see why `acgs-lite` is different from generic guardrails
- trust that the repo is active and credible
