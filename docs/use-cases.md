# Industry Use Cases: Constitutional AI Governance in Practice

**Meta Description**: Explore how the ACGS library is used in healthcare, finance, and legal sectors to ensure AI agent compliance with 2026 regulatory standards.

---

In 2026, AI governance is no longer a "nice-to-have"—it's an operational mandate. Regulated industries use ACGS-Lite to deploy autonomous agents that stay within ethical, legal, and fiduciary bounds.

## 🏥 Healthcare: Clinical Decision Support
In healthcare, agents are used for triage, patient monitoring, and administrative tasks. The **EU AI Act** and **Colorado SB 205** classify these as high-risk activities.

### The Challenge
How do you ensure a patient-facing bot doesn't give unauthorized medical advice or exhibit racial bias in triage?

### The ACGS Solution
1.  **Bias Mitigation**: Load a constitution that filters for discriminatory patterns.
2.  **Escalation Paths**: If an agent detects a high-severity symptom, ACGS-Lite triggers a mandatory human-in-the-loop (HITL) step.
3.  **Compliance Audit**: Every recommendation is logged with the specific rule that allowed it, meeting the EU AI Act's "traceability" requirement.

## 💰 Finance: Credit Approval & Fiduciary Duty
Financial agents are now booking transactions, managing portfolios, and evaluating creditworthiness autonomously.

### The Challenge
Preventing "Black Box" decisions that violate the **ECOA** or **Fair Lending** laws, and ensuring agents don't exceed their fiduciary authority.

### The ACGS Solution
1.  **Impact Scoring**: The `ConstitutionalImpactScorer` identifies high-stakes decisions (e.g., loan denial) and requires a secondary "Validator" agent to sign off.
2.  **Formal Verification**: Use the **Z3 SMT Solver** to mathematically prove that an agent cannot authorize a transaction that exceeds a client's risk profile or account balance.
3.  **Audit Integrity**: Hash-chained logs prove to FINRA or the SEC that no retroactive changes were made to the decision history.

## ⚖️ Legal: Confidentiality & IP Protection
Legal departments use agents for contract review, due diligence, and case research.

### The Challenge
Protecting client-attorney privilege and ensuring agents don't "leak" confidential data into public LLM training sets.

### The ACGS Solution
1.  **PII Filtering**: A CRITICAL severity rule blocks any output containing sensitive patterns (SSNs, private addresses, or case-specific IDs).
2.  **Capability Gating**: Legal agents are "sandboxed" and can only access approved internal databases. Any attempt to query external APIs is blocked by the ACGS engine.
3.  **IP Guardrails**: Rules prevent the agent from generating text that mimics unauthorized digital personas, complying with 2026 IP and deepfake regulations (like Texas TRAIGA).

## 💻 Software Engineering: Governed Coding Agents
Autonomous coding agents (like those powered by MCP) are now writing and deploying production code.

### The Challenge
Preventing an agent from introducing security vulnerabilities or exfiltrating API keys.

### The ACGS Solution
1.  **The Agentic Firewall**: Validates every shell command and file write.
2.  **No-Secrets Rule**: A rule that blocks any file write containing patterns that look like private keys or AWS secrets.
3.  **Chain of Command**: MACI roles ensure that the agent can "Propose" a code change, but only a human or a high-trust "Validator" model can "Execute" the deployment.
