"""X2: Security SWE-bench issues harder under constitutional rules.

Hypothesis: SWE-bench issues with secret patterns are harder to resolve
when a "no secrets in code" constitutional rule is active.

Metrics:
  - resolution_delta <= 15% drop

Failure: Resolution drop >25% or Docker failures >30%.

This is a proxy script using simulated patch correctness since real
SWE-bench requires Docker and long execution times.

Command:
  python x2_swe_secrets.py --trials 20 --seed 42
