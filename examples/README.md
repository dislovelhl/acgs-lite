# ACGS-Lite Examples

Runnable quickstarts covering the core runtime-governance and MACI patterns in `acgs-lite`.
**No API keys are required** for the canonical demo path.

## Canonical demo path

If you only try three things, do them in this order:

### 1. Block an unsafe action
Run [`basic_governance/`](./basic_governance/) first.

```bash
pip install acgs-lite
python examples/basic_governance/main.py
```

This is the fastest proof that `acgs-lite` is real: safe requests pass, harmful requests are blocked, and PII-like input is denied.

### 2. Inspect the audit evidence
Run [`audit_trail/`](./audit_trail/).

```bash
python examples/audit_trail/main.py
```

This shows that governance decisions are not just transient checks, they become tamper-evident evidence.

### 3. Run governance as infrastructure
Run [`mcp_agent_client.py`](./mcp_agent_client.py).

```bash
pip install "acgs-lite[mcp]"
python examples/mcp_agent_client.py
```

This is the shared-service story: agent actions can be validated against a governance server before execution.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install acgs-lite
python examples/basic_governance/main.py

# Optional: MCP example
pip install "acgs-lite[mcp]"
python examples/mcp_agent_client.py
```

## Examples by goal

| Example | What it teaches | Difficulty |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| [`agent_quickstart/`](agent_quickstart/) | **AI-agent install verify**: `GovernedCallable` + MACI + AuditLog in one script; exits 0 on success | ⭐ Beginner |
| [`mcp_agent_client.py`](mcp_agent_client.py) | **MCP Governance Hub**: Connect an agent to a centralized safety server | ⭐⭐ Intermediate |
| [`basic_governance/`](basic_governance/) | Wrap any callable with a `Constitution` + `Rule` objects | ⭐ Beginner |
| [`compliance_eu_ai_act/`](compliance_eu_ai_act/) | EU AI Act risk-tier inference and article-level gap assessment | ⭐⭐ Intermediate |
| [`maci_separation/`](maci_separation/) | Proposer → Validator → Executor role gates; Golden Rule enforcement | ⭐⭐ Intermediate |
| [`audit_trail/`](audit_trail/) | Tamper-evident audit chain; query + JSON export | ⭐⭐ Intermediate |
| [`mock_stub_testing/`](mock_stub_testing/) | `typing.Protocol` + `InMemory*` stub pattern for production-grade testing | ⭐⭐⭐ Advanced |
| [`lean_runtime/`](lean_runtime/) | Lean runtime wrapper + `acgs lean-smoke` setup for real Lean/Lake projects | ⭐⭐ Intermediate |
