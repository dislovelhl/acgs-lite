"""
ACGS Hackathon Starter: Multi-Agent MACI Governance
====================================================
Demonstrates the MACI (Multi-Agent Constitutional Infrastructure) pattern:
Proposer, Validator, and Executor are separate agents that cannot bypass
each other. An agent cannot validate its own proposals.

Usage:
    python hackathon_starter_maci.py

No API keys required.
