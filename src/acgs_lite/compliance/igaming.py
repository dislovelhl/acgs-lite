"""iGaming Compliance (UKGC LCCP + Responsible Gambling) framework module.

Implements compliance obligations for AI systems operating in iGaming contexts
under the UK Gambling Commission's Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP):

- SR-S1: Self-exclusion and cool-off mechanisms
- SR-S2: Reality check notifications
- SR-S3: Deposit, loss, and wager limits
- SR-S4: Problem gambling detection and flagging
- SR-S5: Links to support organisations (GamCare / BeGambleAware)
- ORG-3: Age verification and KYC
- AML-1/2: Anti-money laundering and source of funds verification
- TEC-1/2: RNG certification and RTP disclosure
- AI-1/2/3: AI-specific obligations for personalised offers, risk scoring,
  and prohibition on targeting vulnerable / self-excluded players

Risk tiers:
  HIGH    → gambling, betting, casino, sports_betting domains
  MEDIUM  → generic igaming
  LOW     → unrelated domains

Status: proposed — pending SME review against current LCCP version.
Enforcement date: None (proposed; UKGC enforcement ongoing for licensed operators)

Penalties: UKGC may suspend or revoke operating licence; unlimited fines under
the Gambling Act 2005 for breaches of licence conditions.
